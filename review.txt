#Review 
- Doesn't load any new usernames that are added, throws error saying 'Uncaught (in promise) TypeError: gitTotal is undefined'.

- Lots of commented out code that maybe could be deleted?

- Styling would be a neat addition and a favicon.

- Seed data looks to be adding a lot of API calls on when the page is loaded which is exceeding the API rate limit pretty quick.

####Git
- Line 4 API_URL isn't being used, could be deleted?

- Line 28 function isn't being called or exported anywhere.


####GitTotal
- The function and variable in the function have super similar names, only difference is capitalisation which could get confusing.

- const gitTotal in this file is what was returning as undefined when we tried to run the app.

####RepoInfo
- Can't see if the API stuff works here but looks like a cool/smart way of getting the number of commits! 

####SerchForm
- useEffect and useState are being brought in but not being used.
